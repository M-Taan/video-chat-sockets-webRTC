# video-chat-sockets-webRTC

Learning how socket.io and WebRTC works.
This project is just for learning purposes, it's a proof of concept and a way to get an idea of how to communicate through sockets.

If you get stuck you can follow Kyle's tutorial on the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvlyzDZDEq4&t=1330s
Although it's better to read express, socket.io, and peerJS docs and try to do as much as you can on your own. And if you got stuck follow the tutorial and try to understand the concepts, we all got to start somewhere.
